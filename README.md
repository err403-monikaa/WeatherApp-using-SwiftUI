# Weather

A simple weather app built with SwiftUI and MVVM architecture.


## Features 

- Easy to use.
- Display current weather information based on userâ€™s location.
- View weather forecast for the next 7 days.
- Dynamic background that changes color to reflect day and night.
## SwiftUI Overview

This project is built using SwiftUI, Apple's modern declarative UI framework. SwiftUI simplifies the UI development process, making it more intuitive and efficient.

**Key Features**

- Declarative Syntax: SwiftUI uses a declarative syntax, allowing you to describe the user interface's appearance and behavior in a concise and readable way.
- Swift Integration: Fully integrated with Swift, SwiftUI leverages the power of the language, making UI development more natural for Swift developers.
- Live Preview: Take advantage of the live preview feature in Xcode, enabling real-time visualization of UI changes as you write code.
## API Usage

OpenWeatherMap is an online service that provides global weather data via API, including weather data, forecasts and historical weather data.

- Minute-by-minute hyperlocal precipitation forecast.
- 600 API calls per minute.
- Weather data updates every 2 hours.
- Free API services for non-commercial purposes.
## MVVM Architecture 

This Weather App is designed following the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern, which helps in separating concerns, improving maintainability, and enhancing testability of the codebase.

- **WeatherModel** - Represents the structure of weather data, including current conditions and forecast information.
- **WeatherMainView** - SwiftUI view responsible for rendering the user interface and presenting weather information.
- **WeatherViewModel** - Acts as an intermediary between the WeatherMainView and the WeatherModel. It processes user inputs, fetches weather data, and provides formatted data to the view for display.
